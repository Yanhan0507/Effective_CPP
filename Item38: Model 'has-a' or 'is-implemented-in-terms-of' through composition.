Model 'has-a' or 'is-implemented-in-terms-of' through composition.


1 Application domain (people, vehicles, video frames)
 
2 Implementation domain (buffers, mutexes, buffers ad search trees)

When composition occurs between objects in the application domain, ut expresses a has-a relatinship. When
it occurs in the implementation domain, it expresses an is-implemented-in-terms-of relationship.

Things to remember:
Composition has meanings completely different from that of public inheritance.
In the application domain, composition means has-a. In the implementation dmain, it means is-implemented-in-terms-of.
