Some objects are inherently unique and should disallow the copy assignment and constructor. 
The way to hide the copy assignment and constructor of compile version is to explictly define ur own version, 
and keep it private. Member and friend can still call this function. If you dont want anyone use it, declare it as private
and dont implement it.



HomeForSale(const HomeForSale&);


convention, when u dont want to implement a function, dont give it a parameter name when declaring it.
