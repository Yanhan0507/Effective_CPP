Defining an unused variable may be trivial. We better off postponing definition until we know we ll need it.
It would be even better if we can know initialization arguments for it.


void foo(){
  String x; // define it after if check
  if(){
  return;
  }
  String x;  
  x = "aa"   // default ctor + assignment = not efficient
  String x = "aa" or String x{"a"}  // only copy ctor will be called -> the most efficient way
  //here u define it late enough so that you not only know you need it, but also sure that how it should
  //be initialized.
}

1)

Sting s;
for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
{
  s = "a"
}

2)
for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
{
  String s = "a"
}


1)  1 default ctor + 1 dtor + n assignment
2)  n copy ctor + n dtor
