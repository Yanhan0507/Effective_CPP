If you wanna implement a copy assignment or copy constructor yourself, you need to copy ALL data members. including 
all data members and members in base class.
Even though, you add some new data members in the future, you need to also make corresponding changes in assignment and 
constructor. Complier wont warn/remind you to do so.
you may wanna to remove code duplication, but dont let one to call the other (copy constructor to call copy assignment, 
it makes no sense) you can make a third function to do so.
