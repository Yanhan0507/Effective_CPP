If you use [] in a new expression, you must use [] in the corresponding delete expression.
string *p = new string  delete p
string *p = new string[10] delete[] p

sometimes, typedef makes the situation even more confusing   ( typedef std:sting AssressLines[4])
string *s = new AddressLines   // so u need to be well-documented about your code

try to use class instead (vector, string to avoid array-related operation)
