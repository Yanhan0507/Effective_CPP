Object-oriented principles dictate that data should be as encapsulated as possible.
Counterintuitively, the member function usually yields less encapsulation than the non-member function.

Prefer non-member non-friend functions to member functions. Doing so increases encapsulation, packaging flexibility,
and functional extensibility.
