Encapsulation basically means making data members private.
If we allow user to access data members directly, it could make us very hard to change the code in the future,
since we dont want to affect the existing functionality.
Declare it as "Protected" means all of the children may use it, and all of the code rely on these children will also be affected.
Two takeaways:

1) Declare data members private. It gives clients syntactically uniform access to data, affords find-grained access control,
allows invariants to be enforced and offers class authors implementation flexibility.
2) Protected is no more encapsulated than public.
