Default constructor, assignment operator and destrcutor will be generated by compiler if user did provide one.

It will be shallow copy, and destructor will simply call the destructor of all data members. 
T *P. delete P would not be called bacause it is a POD.  T P is fine (default destructor will be called)

new delete always come in pair.
