A couple of issues to think before designing a new class.

Good types have a natural syntax, intuitive semantics and one or more efficient implementations.

How should objects of your new type be created and destroyed?
how should object initialization differ from object assignment?
What does it mean for objects of your new type to be passed by value?
What are the restrictions on legal values for your new type?
Does your new type fit into an inheritance graph?
What kind of type conversions are allowed for your new type?
What operators and functions make sense for the new type?
What standard functions should be disallowed?
Who should have access to the members of your new type?
What is the “undeclared interface” of your new type?
How general is your new type?
Is a new type really what you need?
