Two different functions can be inherited:
1) virtual
2) non-virtual   -> this kind of function should not be redefined. So we will only discuss the first case.

The reason is that: default parameters are statically bound, while static parameters are dynamically bound.
(for runtime effiency)

Class Shape{
  virtual draw(Color = red){}
}

Rectangle: public Shape{
  virtual draw(Color = green){}
}

Shape *ps =new Rectangle

ps -> draw()  it will draw a 'Rectangle' with 'Red'. 

Things to rememberï¼›
Never redefine an inherited default parameter value, because default parameter values are statically bound, while virtual 
functions - only functions you should be redefining - are dynamically bound.
