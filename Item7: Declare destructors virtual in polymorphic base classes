virtual desturctor for base class

pure virtual function implicitly yields an abstract class
using virtual function to avoid memory leak
class not designed to be a base class should not have a virtual destructor. virtual destrcutor will require vptr and vtable
which will increase the cost of each object. (but if this class already had a vitrual function, it's fine)

Any class with virtual function should almost certainly have a virtual destructor 
1 having virtual function means, designed to be a base class
2 having virtual function means already had a vptr already, so no extra cost for vptr to have this virtual destructor
